    <p>
        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering (2021-2025) at C. Abdul Hakeem College, under Anna University, with a current CGPA of 8.0. Throughout my college journey, I have gained valuable experience both academically and personally. As the coordinator for the Web Essentials module, I assist my peers in mastering web development fundamentals,
        which has enhanced my leadership and technical skills. I have successfully cleared all subjects in the current semester, demonstrating my commitment to my studies.
        In addition to academics, I have developed a strong foundation in programming, data science, and machine learning. My college experience has also provided opportunities for hands-on learning through mini projects and internships, where I apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. Overall, my time at C. Abdul Hakeem College has equipped me with the skills and knowledge to pursue a successful career in technology.
